# SOLARIS
A Solana Blockchain Based Platform to Facilitate Transactions to Fund Land Development Projects
This platform will be used as Proof of Concept for future investors in the technology
I don't know code, but I can communicate and get ANYTHING done, is my attitude.

I am leading this project with 6 years of Project Management practice in Construction of City Assets and currently in my 3rd year Project Managing Multi-Family Developments with a General Contracting company.

This platform is not necessary, but it is something I can find use of.

The main goal, to put it simply, is to invite crowdfunders from around the world to fund a Construction project that will be overturned to the holders of the projects cryptocurrency token. A simple experiment and proof-of-concept. Decentralized.

This project will be the next challenge that I face for the next 5-10 years. Delighted to be building in Web 3 again.

Inbox is open on all channels for inquiries.
Nothing else here other than Whitepaper:
